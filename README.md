# RMT_munin
Munin plugins (Used under FreeBSD 8/9/10/11/12). Most of these plugins are FreeBSD specific. Some plugins are forked from other authors with minor changes (mostly Linux to FreeBSD changes, category simplification, etc.).


Future
===
As I switched from Munin to Zabbix few months ago these plugins are not maintained anymore and I will not test them with upcomming FreeBSD versions.
