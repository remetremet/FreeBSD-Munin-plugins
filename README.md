# RMT_munin
Munin plugins (Used under FreeBSD 8/9/10/11/12)

Most plugins are FreeBSD specific.
Some plugins are forked from other authors with minor changes (mostly Linux to FreeBSD changes, category simplification, etc.).


As I switched from Munin to Zabbix few months ago these plugins are not maintained anymore and I will not test them with upcomming FreeBSD versions.
